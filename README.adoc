= TodoAndroid

This will be the TodoMore Android client.

== Unfinished Warning

As of today it certainly is not fully working - don't try to use it unless you can code the parts that are missing.
The next bit push is that the SyncAdapter starts but isn't really coded yet, so don't run it against
a database of real TODOs.

Next up in this area will be a delete feature; it's harder because you have to atomically commit in two
places, and you can't.

== Security Warning

This version caches your password, unencrypted, in the shared preferences.
Somebody who finds your phone AND knows what they're doing could modify
or corrupt your TODO listings.

Please fix this and send a pull request!
